            Swimming is the ideal match for you if you don't love working up a sweat but do love the benefits of a cardio workout. The water keeps you cool, even as your heart gets a great workout. You'll probably be able to keep yourself going for a longer time than if you were running. That's because it is pleasurable and calm on your joints and muscles.

            The team of professionally experienced trainers we have always recommend to plan on doing 2 ½ hours of swimming every week, or combine it with other cardio workouts. You can set your own pace, going as fast as you like. Most people swim laps in the pool. If you swim in a lake or ocean, make sure you know how to stay safe in the open water with currents.

            Swimming is just about as good as it gets for a complete workout. If you are pregnant, the buoyancy of the water will take stress off your joints. If you swam before you become pregnant, you will likely be able to continue swimming unless you have an issue with your pregnancy. It is a great aerobic workout for the ones with arthritis.
